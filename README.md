[SIZE="4"][COLOR="Red"]Disclaimer[/COLOR]
I am not responsible for bricked devices, dead SD cards, thermonuclear war, or you getting fired because the alarm app failed. Please do some research if you have any concerns about features included in this ROM before flashing it!

[COLOR="Red"]Some personal thoughts about this:[/COLOR]
 - This is a v1.0 release which means, that not everything is perfect.
 - The most important help will be, that if you use my ROM and see something unusual(bugs, lags etc.) report it to me in this thread or on Telegram(Group below).
